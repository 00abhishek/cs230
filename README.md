# cs230 - NBA 2K19 DeepBot
This repository contains the code for our CS 230: Deep Learning project from Stanford University. The code contained within carries out tasks which 1) takes in NBA 2K19 input from an Xbox, 2) creates bounding boxes which "comprehend" the incoming frame images, 3) feeds the bounding box image data to a neural network, 4) suggests a controller input to the game based on the input data, and 5) sends this controller data back to the Xbox via a virtual controller. The result is a bot which plays 2K19 autonomously.
